<h2 id="Subtraction">What is subtraction?</h2>
<p>
  Subtracting is also very simple, and just like we did for addition, let's start with an example.
  <span class="block">Sally has 5 apples and then she gives 2 away. How many apples does she have now?</span>
  If you said 3 you are correct, and you just subtracted. It's just as simple as adding.
  Just like with adding you could think of each number represeting a number of objects.
  You write a subtraction equation like this: 5 - 3 = 2, since - is the subtraction symbol, also know as the minus sign (shown at the bottom of the page).
  Unlike addition, the placement of the numbers in a subtraction equation matter, 5 - 3 is not the same as 3 - 5.
