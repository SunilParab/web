<h2 id="Addition">What is addition?</h2>
<p>
  Adding is very simple, but before we start lets look at a simple question.
  <span class="block">Sally has 2 apples and then she gets 3 more. How many apples does she have now?</span>
  If you said 5 you're correct, and you just added! It really is that simple.
  You can just think of each number representing a number of objects and then combine the objects from those number before counting all the objects to get the final number of objects.
  You write an addition equation like this: 2 + 3 = 5, since + is the addition symbol, also known as the plus sign (shown at the bottom of the page).
  The order of the number in the equation don't matter, 5 + 3 is the same as 3 + 5.
