<h2 id="Division">What is division?</h2>
<p>
  Division is the most complicated of the 4 basic math functions.
  Division is spliting a number into multiple groups, as shown in the example below. 
  <span class="block">Sally has 6 apples and she shares them with her friend. How many apples does each person have now?</span>
  The answer is 3 since 6 can be split into 2 groups of 3.
  Division can also be thought of as undoing multiplication.
  4 x 2 = 8, so 8 divded by 2 equals 4 and 8 divided by 4 equals 2.
  The number that is multiplied by the second number in the equation to get the first number is the asnwer to the equation.
  When typing, / is the symbol used for dividing since the written division symbol is not on keyboards, also know as the division sign, so division is typed as 8 / 4 = 2.
  The normal division symbol can be seen at the bottom of the page.
  Just like subtraction, the placement of the numbers does matter, 6 / 3 is not the same as 3 / 6.
