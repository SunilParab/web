<h2 id="Multiplication">What is multiplication?</h2>
<p>
  Multilication is a bit hard to learn at first but it is very easy once you understand it.
  Multiplication is basically repeated adding, like in the following example.
  <span class="block">Sally gets 2 apples from her dad, 2 more from her mother, 2 more from her brother, and 2 more from her friend. How many apples does she have now?</span>
  If you want to add 2 4 times you could write the equation 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8, but this is really long.
  Instead you could just write 2 x 4 = 8 which is much faster and is also a multiplication equation.
  You write a mltiplication equation using x as the symbol, also know as the multiplication sign (shown at the bottom of the page), and to solve a multiplication equation you have to add one of the numbers to itself the other number amount of times.
  Just like addition, the placement of the numbers don't matter, 5 x 3 is the same as 3 x 5.
