<h2>1. Addition</h2>
<p>
  Adding is very simple, but before we start lets look at a simple question.
  Sally has 2 apples and she got 3 more, how many apples does she have now?
  If you said 5 you're correct, and you just added! It really is that simple. You can just think of each number representing a number of objects and then combine the objects from those number before counting all the objects to get the final number of objects, which is called a sum.
