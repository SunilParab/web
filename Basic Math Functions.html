<h2>1. Addition</h2>
<p>
  Adding is very simple, but before we start lets look at a simple question.
  Sally has 2 apples and then she gets 3 more, how many apples does she have now?
  If you said 5 you're correct, and you just added! It really is that simple. You can just think of each number representing a number of objects and then combine the objects from those number before counting all the objects to get the final number of objects, which is called a sum.
  You write an addition equation like this: 2 + 3 = 5, + is the addition symbol.
  The order of the number is the equation don't matter, 5 + 3 is the same as 3 + 5

<h2>2. Subtraction</h2>
<p>
  Subtracting is also very simple, and just we did for addition, let's start with an example.
  Sally has 5 apples and then she gives 2 away, how many apples does she have now?
  If you said 3 you are correct, and you just subtracted. It's just as simple as adding. Just like with adding you could think of each number represeting a number of objects.
  You write a subtraction equation like this: 5 - 3 = 2, + is the subtraction symbol.
  Unlike addition, the placement of the numbers in a subtraction equation matter, 5 - 3 is not the same as 3 - 5.

<h2>3. Multiplication</h2>
<p>
  Multilication is a bit hard to learn at first but it is very easy once you understand it.
  Multiplication is basically repeated adding. If you want to add 2 4 times you would write the equation 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8, but this is really long. Instead you could wirte 2 x 4 = 8 which is much faster and is also a multiplication equation.
  You write a mltiplication equaltion using x as the symbol, and to solve a multiplication equation you have to add one of the numbers to itself the other number amount of times.
  Just like addition, the placement of the numbers don't matter, 5 x 3 is the same as 3 x 5.

<h2>4. Division</h2>
<p>
  Division is the most complicated of the 4 basic math functions.
  Division is basically undoing multiplication. 4 x 2 = 8, but 8 divded by 2 equals 4 and 8 divided by 4 equals 2.
  What ever number is multiplied by the second number in the equation to get the first number is the asnwer to the equation.
  When typing / is the symbol for dividing, so division is typed as 8 / 4 = 2
  Just like subtraction, the placement of the numbers does matter, 6 / 3 is not the same as 3 / 6.
